Global protest of russians against war and terror in more than [20 countries (and counting)](https://taplink.cc/futurewithoutwar)


The new school year will soon begin in many countries.

These days we want to remind the whole world that criminal Russian aggression on the sovereign territory of Ukraine continues to claim and ruin children's lives.

Due to the Russian invasion many children have been killed or injured and their schools have been destroyed.

Families were forced to leave Ukraine as refugees, and their children have to continue to study in a non-native language.

Ukrainian children behind Russian lines were deported throughout Russia and forcibly "adopted" by Russian families.

Join us
* to condemn war and support Ukraine
* to support people protesting against war in Russia, despite repressions
* to honour the memory of those killed in Ukraine
* to discuss ways of humanitarian assistance
