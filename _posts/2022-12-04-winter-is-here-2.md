04.12.2022 Cyprus, Limassol

The bloody full-scale war has already been going on for 286 days.

Putin and the Russian army are destroying critical civilian infrastructure of the Ukrainian cities in  an attempt to break the spirit of the Ukrainians. While we are staying in safe and warm conditions, many Ukrainians have to survive a blackout with no heating or access to water.

On 4 December 2022 we held a Stop Terror / Winter is Here rally in Limassol, Cyprus, to raise funds in support of Ukrainians. We spoke of charitable initiatives, held an auction, and thanks to Nick and his magical Hang music we collected lots of donations to fund the purchase of generators for Ukrainian hospitals.

We thank everyone who joined us in the rally.
