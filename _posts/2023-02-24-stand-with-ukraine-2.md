PRESS RELEASE

Over 400 People Join Russian Anti-War Rallies in Limassol and Nicosia

On 24 February, the anniversary of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into
Ukraine, the Russian Anti-War Community in Cyprus staged rallies in Limassol and Nicosia to
protest against the war, the regime of Vladimir Putin and in solidarity with the victims of Putin’s
war against Ukraine. The protests were a part of the global action held by the Russian
diasporas worldwide on the anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine ([The year of terror](https://theyearofterror.com)).

The rallies were held in Limassol and Nicosia, where a total of over 400 people attended the
action.

At the primary action in Limassol, over 300 people attended. Following the protest at the
Honorary Russian Consulate against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the domestic Russian
repression, the protesters marched towards the Molos Amphitheatre through the Old Town. At
the Amphitheater, the protesters shared their personal stories of being affected by the war and
the repression.

At the auxiliary rally in Nicosia, some 100 people assembled at the Russian Embassy to protest.
During the rally, the activists were being recorded by the Embassy staff from inside the building.
By the end of the action, several unidentified middle-aged men in civilian clothing attempted to
film the protesters while hurling insults at them in Russian, to be eventually chased off by the
police.

Following the protest, the Nicosia activists marched towards the Eleftheria Square where they
joined the Ukrainian action ([Light Will Win Over Darkness](https://www.facebook.com/events/5922254947811834)).
