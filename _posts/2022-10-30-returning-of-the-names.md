30.10.2022 Cyprus, Limassol

On 30 October we have taken part in the Returning of the Names initiated by the Memorial centre.

Over 30 people had gathered together near the Russian consulate in Limassol, where we have, once again, denounced the domestic and external terrorism conducted by the Russian regime, as well as protested against the unending internal repression in Russia. We read out loud names of people repressed and executed by the Soviets, and shared the stories of how repression affected our own families. Every single person born in the territory of the former Soviet Union has relatives that had been arrested, imprisoned, deported or executed by the state, lest we forget.

We are particularly grateful to our Ukrainian friends who had decided to join us at the rally. We stand with Ukraine!
